+ ## Slide 2: Introduction to Scope 
## Definition of Scope: Scope determines the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime.
## Importance of Scope: Understanding scope is crucial for debugging and writing clean, efficient code.
+ ## Slide 3: Types of Scope in JavaScript 
## Global Scope
## Variables declared outside any function or block.
## Accessible from anywhere in the code. 
## Slide 4: Global Scope Detailed
## Characteristics:
## Created when the script first loads.
## Variables declared in global scope are properties of the window object (in browsers).
## Risks: 
## Risk of variable name collisions.
## Can lead to hard-to-maintain code.
## Slide 5: Function Scope Detailed
## Characteristics:
## Created whenever a function is invoked.
## Variables are accessible only within the function and its nested functions.
## Slide 6: Block Scope Detailed
## Characteristics:
## Introduced with let and const in ES6.
## Restricted to the block in which it is defined.
# JS HOSTING

## Slide 2: Introduction to Hoisting
## Definition: Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s behavior of moving declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.
## Slide 3: How Hoisting Works
## Compilation Phase: JavaScript engine scans the code and moves declarations (variables and functions) to the top.
## Execution Phase: Code is executed line by line with declarations already in place.
## Slide 4: Hoisting of Variable Declarations
## var Declaration:
## Hoisted to the top of the function or global scope.
## Slide 5: Hoisting with let and const
## let and const Declarations:
## Hoisted to the top of the block scope.
## Do not get initialized, leading to a "temporal dead zone" until their actual declaration is encountered.
# JS TDZ

## Slide 2: Introduction to TDZ
## Definition: Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) refers to the period within a block where a variable is in scope but cannot be accessed until it is declared.
## Relevance: Helps avoid accessing variables before they are fully initialized, leading to more predictable code.
## Slide 3: Variable Declarations and Hoisting
## Hoisting Basics: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, while let and const are also hoisted but come with a TDZ. 
## Slide 4: TDZ with let and const
## let and const:
## Hoisted: Declarations are hoisted to the top of their block scope.
## TDZ: Accessing the variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError.
